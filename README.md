# Bouncing Ballz

This is a simple HTML5 canvas game where players can create balls (circles) by clicking on the screen. The balls will fall under the influence of gravity, bounce off the ground, and eventually come to a stop.

## Setup Instructions

**1. Download or Clone the Repository**

First, you need to download the game files. You can clone the repository using Git.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

**2. Navigate to the Project Directory**

Open the extracted folder or the cloned repository in your file explorer or use the terminal to navigate to the project directory.

```
cd path/to/your-repo-name
```

## Execution Instructions

**1. Open the index.html File**

To start the game, you simply need to open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the index.html file or right-clicking on it and selecting "Open with" and then choosing your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can open the file through your terminal:

```
open index.html
```

If you are using a terminal on Windows, you can use:

```
start index.html
```

**2. Enjoy the Game**

Once the `index.html` file is open in your browser, the game will start automatically. Click anywhere on the canvas to create new balls. The balls will fall due to gravity, bounce off the ground, and eventually come to a stop.

## Features

* Click on the canvas to create new circles.
* Circles obey Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen.
* Circles bounce off the ground and gradually come to a stop.
* Different colors for each circle to make the game visually appealing.

## No Dependencies

This game does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

* `index.html` - The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the JavaScript code.
* `style.css` - (Optional) The CSS file for styling the canvas and other elements.
* `script.js` - The JavaScript file containing the logic for ball creation, gravity, and bouncing mechanics.
